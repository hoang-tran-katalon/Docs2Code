You can configure two-factor authentication using a mobile app or via text message,0
You can also add a security key,0
We strongly recommend using a time-based one-time password (TOTP) application to configure 2FA,0
"TOTP applications are more reliable than SMS, especially for locations outside the United States",0
TOTP apps support the secure backup of your authentication codes in the cloud and can be restored if you lose access to your device,0

About GitHub's use of your dataGitHub aggregates metadata and parses content patterns for the purposes of delivering generalized insights within the product,0
"It uses data from public repositories, and also uses metadata and aggregate data from private repositories when a repository's owner has chosen to share the data with GitHub through an opt-in",0
"If you opt a private repository into data use, then it will perform read-only analysis of that specific private repository",0
"By default, all public repositories are included in the GitHub Archive Program, a partnership between GitHub and organizations such as Software Heritage Foundation and Internet Archive to ensure the long-term preservation of the world's open source software",0

GitHub will audit its existing suppliers and require those in such higher risk areas to confirm that they provide services consistent with this Statement,0
"Although GitHub knows of no actual or alleged modern slavery or child labor in its business or supply chain, and has no credible basis to believe it is occurring, GitHub is committed to providing remedies if GitHub itself were to directly cause modern slavery or child labor and to remediation of broader patterns of non-conformance with this Statement caused by deficiencies in GitHub's systems or processes",0

Overview and PurposeMillions of developers host millions of projects on GitHub — both open and closed source — and we're honored to play a part in enabling collaboration across the developer community every day,0
"Together, we all have an exciting opportunity and responsibility to make this a community we can be proud of",0
"The GitHub Community Forum is intended to be a place for further collaboration, support, and brainstorming",0
"This is a civilized place for connecting with other users, learning new skills, sharing feedback and ideas, and finding all the support you need for your GitHub projects",0
"By participating in this Community, you are agreeing to the same Terms of Service that apply to GitHub",0
"com, as well as this Community-specific Code of Conduct",0
"With this Code of Conduct, we hope to help you understand how best to collaborate in the GitHub Community Forum, what you can expect from moderators, and what type of actions or content may result in temporary or permanent suspension from Community participation",0
We will investigate any abuse reports and may moderate public content within the Community that we determine to be in violation of either the GitHub Terms of Service or this Code of Conduct,0
"GitHub users worldwide bring wildly different perspectives, ideas, and experiences, and range from people who created their first ""Hello World"" project last week to the most well-known software developers in the world",0
"We are committed to making GitHub and the GitHub Community Forum a welcoming environment for all the different voices and perspectives here, while maintaining a space where people are free to express themselves",0
"PledgeIn the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in the GitHub Community Forum a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, ability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation",0
StandardsTreat the GitHub Community Forum with respect,0
"We are a shared resource — a place to share skills, knowledge, and interests through ongoing conversation",0
"The following are not hard and fast rules, merely aids to the human judgment of our Community",0
"Use these guidelines to keep this a clean, well-lighted place for civilized public discourse",0
Best Practices for Building a Strong CommunityBe respectful and considerate,0
Be welcoming and open-minded,0
"Other Community members may not have the same experience level or background as you, but that doesn't mean they don't have good ideas to contribute",0
We encourage you to be welcoming to new members and those just getting started,0
Respect each other,0
Nothing sabotages healthy conversation like rudeness,0
"Be civil and professional, and don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech",0
Don’t harass or grief anyone,0
Treat each other with dignity and consideration in all interactions,0
You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it,0
That’s fine,0
"But remember to criticize ideas, not people",0
"Avoid name-calling, ad hominem attacks, responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content, and knee-jerk contradiction",0
"Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation",0
Communicate with empathy,0
Disagreements or differences of opinion are a fact of life,0
"Being part of a community means interacting with people from a variety of backgrounds and perspectives, many of which may not be your own",0
"If you disagree with someone, try to understand and share their feelings before you address them",0
"This will promote a respectful and friendly atmosphere where people feel comfortable asking questions, participating in discussions, and making contributions",0
Contribute in a positive and constructive way,0
Improve the discussion,0
"Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small",0
"If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later",0
"The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too",0
"Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said",0
Be clear and stay on topic,0
Communicating with strangers on the Internet can be awkward,0
"It's hard to convey or read tone, and sarcasm is frequently misunderstood",0
"Try to use clear language, and think about how it will be received by the other person",0
"This applies to sharing links, as well",0
Any links shared in the Community Forum should be shared with the intent of providing relevant and appropriate information,0
Links should not be posted to simply drive traffic or attention to a site,0
Links should always be accompanied by a full explanation of the content and purpose of the link,0
"Posting links, especially unsolicited ones, without relevant and valuable context can come across as advertising or serving even more malicious purposes",0
"Additionally, the GitHub Community Forum is for collaboration, sharing ideas, and helping each other get stuff done",0
"Off-topic comments are a distraction (sometimes welcome, but usually not) from getting work done and being productive",0
Staying on topic helps produce positive and productive discussions,0
Share mindfully,0
"When asking others to give you feedback or collaborate on a project, only share valuable and relevant resources to provide context",0
"Don't post links that don't add value to the Topic, and don't post unsolicited links to your own projects or sites on other user's threads",0
"Additionally, don't share sensitive information",0
This includes your own email address,0
"We don't allow the sharing of such information in this Community Forum, as it can create security and privacy risks for the poster, as well as other users",0
"If you'd like to invite other Forum members to collaborate on a project or work with you, share a link to the repository in which the project you are working on exists",0
By sharing the link to your project repo - with some information on what your project is and what kind of help or feedback you're looking for - you can invite others to collaborate with you via issues or pull requests without having to share your private information,0
You can also add others as outside collaborators on your project repo to give them special permissions to help you develop your project,0
Keep it tidy,0
"Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less time cleaning up",0
So:Don’t start a topic in the wrong category,0
Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics,0
Don’t post no-content replies,0
"Don't ""bump"" posts, unless you have new and relevant information to share",0
Don’t divert a topic by changing it midstream,0
"Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Kudos button",0
"Rather than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction, open a new topic",0
Be trustworthy,0
Always be honest,0
Don’t knowingly share incorrect information or intentionally mislead other GitHub Community Forum members,0
"If you don’t know the answer to someone’s question but still want to help, you can try helping them research or find resources instead",0
"GitHub staff will also be active in the Community, so if you’re unsure of an answer, it’s likely a moderator will be able to help",0
What is not AllowedThreats of violence,0
"You may not threaten violence towards others or use the site to organize, promote, or incite acts of real-world violence or terrorism",0
"Think carefully about the words you use, the images you post, and even the software you write, and how they may be interpreted by others",0
"Even if you mean something as a joke, it might not be received that way",0
"If you think that someone else might interpret the content you post as a threat, or as promoting violence or terrorism, stop",0
Don't post it,0
"In extraordinary cases, we may report threats of violence to law enforcement if we think there may be a genuine risk of physical harm or a threat to public safety",0
Hate speech and discrimination,0
"While it is not forbidden to broach topics such as age, body size, ability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation, we do not tolerate speech that attacks a person or group of people on the basis of who they are",0
"Just realize that talking about these or other sensitive topics can make others feel unwelcome, or perhaps even unsafe, if approached in an aggressive or insulting manner",0
We expect our Community members to be respectful when discussing sensitive topics,0
Bullying and harassment,0
We do not tolerate bullying or harassment,0
This means any habitual badgering or intimidation targeted at a specific person or group of people,0
"In general, if your actions are unwanted and you continue to engage in them, there's a good chance you are headed into bullying or harassment territory",0
Impersonation,0
"You may not impersonate another person by copying their avatar, posting content under their email address, intentionally using a deceptively similar username or otherwise posing as someone else",0
Impersonation is a form of harassment,0
Doxxing and invasion of privacy,0
"Don't post other people's personal information, such as phone numbers, private email addresses, physical addresses, credit card numbers, Social Security/National Identity numbers, or passwords",0
"Depending on the context, such as in the case of intimidation or harassment, we may consider other information, such as photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent, to be an invasion of privacy, especially when such material presents a safety risk to the subject",0
Prurient/Sexually explicit content,0
"Basically, don't post pornography",0
This does not mean that all nudity or sexual content is prohibited,0
"We recognize that sexuality is a part of life and non-pornographic sexual content may be a part of your project, or may be presented for educational or artistic purposes",0
"If you have any questions or concerns about something you want to post, feel free to reach out and ask beforehand",0
Spam,0
Respect the GitHub Community Forum,0
"Don’t post advertisements, link to spammy websites, or otherwise vandalize the Community",0
"This Community is meant for GitHub users to discuss projects, learn, and share ideas with one another - not for advertising or other spam-like content",0
Content that we deem spammy will be removed,0
Copyrighted or illegal content,0
Only post your own stuff,0
You are responsible for what you post,0
"If you post something you didn’t create yourself, you must have the right to post it",0
"You may not post illegal content, including content illegal under copyright and trademark laws, links to illegal content, or methods for circumventing the law",0
Active malware or exploits,0
Being part of this Community includes not taking advantage of other members of the Community,0
We do not allow anyone to use our platform for exploit delivery (e,0
g,0
Using the Community as a means to deliver malicious executables) or as attack infrastructure (e,0
g,0
Organizing denial of service attacks or managing command and control servers),0
"Note, however, that we do not prohibit the posting of source code which could be used to develop malware or exploits, as the publication and distribution of such source code has educational value and provides a net benefit to the security community",0
Anyone under the age of 13,0
"If you're a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account on the GitHub Community Forum (or GitHub itself)",0
GitHub does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13,0
"If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will unfortunately have to close both your GitHub Community Forum and GitHub",0
com accounts,0
"We don't want to discourage you from learning to code, but those are the rules",0
Please see our Terms of Service for information about account termination,0
Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting,0
The GitHub Community Forum is a professional space and should be treated as such,0
"EnforcementWhat GitHub Community Forum Members Can DoIf you see a problem, report it",0
Moderators have special authority; they are responsible for this Community,0
But so are you,0
"With your help, moderators can be Community facilitators, not just janitors or police",0
"When you see bad behavior, don’t reply",0
"It encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time",0
"Just report it via ""Report Inappropriate Content"" in the Option Menu",0
"If enough reports accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention",0
Our ResponsibilitiesThere are a variety of actions that we may take in response to inappropriate behavior or content,0
It usually depends on the exact circumstances of a particular case,0
We recognize that sometimes people may say or do inappropriate things for any number of reasons,0
Perhaps they did not realize how their words would be perceived,0
Or maybe they just let their emotions get the best of them,0
"Of course, sometimes, there are folks who just want to spam or cause trouble",0
"Each case requires a different approach, and we try to tailor our response to meet the needs of the situation",0
We'll review each situation on a case-by-case basis,0
"In each case, we will have a diverse team investigate the content and surrounding facts and respond as appropriate, using this Code of Conduct to guide our decision",0
"Actions we may take in response to a flag or abuse report include, but are not limited to:Content RemovalContent BlockingCommunity Forum Account SuspensionCommunity Forum Account TerminationCommunity Forum moderators who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the Community Forum’s leadership",0
"Contacting GitHub StaffIf, for any reason, you want to contact GitHub Staff, the Community Managers, Administrators, or Moderators of this forum privately, you can use our Support contact form",0
Contacting any member of GitHub Staff via channels other than the forum itself or the Support contact form is strongly discouraged and may be considered a violation of our prohibition against harassment,0
Let's work together to keep the forum a place where people feel safe to participate by being respectful of them and their time,0
"Legal NoticesYes, legalese is boring, but we must protect ourselves – and by extension, you and your data – against unfriendly folks",0
"We have a Terms of Service and Privacy Statement describing your (and our) behavior and rights related to content, privacy, and laws",0
"To use this service, you must agree to abide by our Terms of Service and the Privacy Statement",0
This Code of Conduct does not modify our Terms of Service and is not intended to be a complete list,0
"GitHub retains full discretion under the Terms of Service to remove any content or terminate any accounts for activity that is ""unlawful, offensive, threatening, libelous, defamatory, pornographic, obscene or otherwise objectionable or violates any party's intellectual property or these Terms of Service",0

We want people to work better together,0
"Although we maintain the site, this is a community we build together, and we need your help to make it the best it can be",0
"Be welcoming and open-minded - Other collaborators may not have the same experience level or background as you, but that doesn't mean they don't have good ideas to contribute",0

We do not actively monitor the site for offensive content,0
"If you run into something or someone on the site that you find objectionable, here are some tools GitHub provides to help you take action immediately:Communicate expectations - If you participate in a community that has not set their own, community-specific guidelines, encourage them to do so either in the README or CONTRIBUTING file, or in a dedicated code of conduct, by submitting a pull request",0
"Moderate Comments - If you have write-access privileges for a repository, you can edit, delete, or hide anyone's comments on commits, pull requests, and issues",0

"In general, if your actions are unwanted and you continue to engage in them, there's a good chance you are headed into bullying or harassment territory",0
Disrupting the experience of other users Being part of a community includes recognizing how your behavior affects others and engaging in meaningful and productive interactions with people and the platform they rely on,0
"Behaviors such as repeatedly posting off-topic comments, opening empty or meaningless issues or pull requests, or using any other platform feature in a way that continually disrupts the experience of other users are not allowed",0
"While we encourage maintainers to moderate their own projects on an individual basis, GitHub staff may take further restrictive action against accounts that are engaging in these types of behaviors",0
"Impersonation You may not seek to mislead others as to your identity by copying another person's avatar, posting content under their email address, using a similar username or otherwise posing as someone else",0

A clear warning or disclaimer in other contexts helps users make an educated decision as to whether or not they want to engage with such content,0
"Misinformation and disinformation You may not post content that presents a distorted view of reality, whether it is inaccurate or false (misinformation) or is intentionally deceptive (disinformation) where such content is likely to result in harm to the public or to interfere with fair and equal opportunities for all to participate in public life",0
"For example, we do not allow content that may put the well-being of groups of people at risk or limit their ability to take part in a free and open society",0
"We encourage active participation in the expression of ideas, perspectives, and experiences and may not be in a position to dispute personal accounts or observations",0
"We generally allow parody and satire that is in line with our Acceptable Use Polices, and we consider context to be important in how information is received and understood; therefore, it may be appropriate to clarify your intentions via disclaimers or other means, as well as the source(s) of your information",0
Active malware or exploits Being part of a community includes not taking advantage of other members of the community,0
"We do not allow anyone to use our platform for exploit delivery, such as using GitHub as a means to deliver malicious executables, or as attack infrastructure, for example by organizing denial of service attacks or managing command and control servers",0
"Note, however, that we do not prohibit the posting of source code which could be used to develop malware or exploits, as the publication and distribution of such source code has educational value and provides a net benefit to the security community",0
What happens if someone breaks the rules?There are a variety of actions that we may take when a user reports inappropriate behavior or content,0
It usually depends on the exact circumstances of a particular case,0
We recognize that sometimes people may say or do inappropriate things for any number of reasons,0
Perhaps they did not realize how their words would be perceived,0
Or maybe they just let their emotions get the best of them,0
"Of course, sometimes, there are folks who just want to spam or cause trouble",0
"Each case requires a different approach, and we try to tailor our response to meet the needs of the situation that has been reported",0
We'll review each abuse report on a case-by-case basis,0
"In each case, we will have a diverse team investigate the content and surrounding facts and respond as appropriate, using these guidelines to guide our decision",0
"Actions we may take in response to an abuse report include but are not limited to:Content RemovalContent BlockingAccount SuspensionAccount TerminationLegal NoticesWe dedicate these Community Guidelines to the public domain for anyone to use, reuse, adapt, or whatever, under the terms of CC0-1",0

"(""GitHub"", ""we"") provides this statement to those residents (""you"") in accordance with requirements under the CCPA to make certain disclosures about the collection and processing of their personal information",0
This is GitHub’s California-specific description of consumers’ privacy rights under the CCPA,0
"For information about how we’ve extended the CCPA core rights to control personal information to all of our users in the United States, please see our Privacy Statement",0
"We do not sell your personal informationUnder the CCPA, a business that sells California residents' personal information to others: 1) must give notice to California residents before selling their personal information to others; and 2) must provide the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information",0
"GitHub does not sell personal information, including personal information of anyone under 16 years old",0
"Thus, these notification and opt-out requirements do not apply to GitHub",0
Your rights under the CCPAThe CCPA provides California residents with certain rights related to their personal information,0
"To submit a request based on these rights, please contact us via our contact form",0
"When receiving a request, we will verify that the individual making the request is the resident to whom the personal information subject to the request pertains",0
California residents may exercise their rights themselves or may use an authorized agent to make requests to disclose certain information about the processing of their personal information or to delete personal information on their behalf,0
"If you use an authorized agent to submit a request, we may require that you provide us additional information demonstrating that the agent is acting on your behalf",0
"With respect to their personal information, California residents may exercise the rights described below",0
1,1
"Right to know what personal information is being collected, for what purposes and with whom it is sharedCalifornia residents have the right to request from a business disclosure of the categories and specific pieces of personal information it has collected from them in the preceding 12 months, the categories of sources from which such personal information is collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling such personal information, and the categories of third parties with whom the business shares personal information",0
"If you request that a business disclose categories and specific pieces of personal information collected about you, you have the right to receive that information, free of charge, twice a year",0
"The information may be delivered by mail or electronically and, if provided electronically, shall be in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows the California resident to relatively easily transmit this information to another entity",0

10,0
User ProtectionYou must not engage in activity that significantly harms other users,0
We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting users as a whole,0
"What is this?From time to time, GitHub receives requests from governments to remove content that has been declared unlawful in their local jurisdiction",0
"Although we may not always agree with those laws, we may need to block content if we receive a complete request from a government official so that our users in that jurisdiction may continue to have access to GitHub to collaborate and build software",0
"What is a complete government takedown request?To count as a complete request, a request or notice mustcome from a relevant, official government agencyidentify illegal contentspecify the source of illegality in that jurisdiction (law or court order)",0
"What happens when we receive a complete takedown request from a government?When we receive a notice from a relevant, official government agency that identifies illegal content and specifies the source of the illegality, wenotify the affected users of the specific content that allegedly violates the law, and that this is a legal takedown requestallow the affected users to appeal the decision as part of that notificationlimit the geographic scope of the takedown when possible and include that as part of the notificationpost the official request that led to the takedown in our public gov-takedowns repository",0
"Why do we publicly post takedown notices?We are concerned about Internet censorship, and believe that transparency on a specific and ongoing level is essential to good governance",0
"By publicly posting the notices, we can better inform the public about what content is being withheld from GitHub, and why",0
We post takedown notices to document their potential to chill speech,0
What does it mean if we post a notice in our gov-takedowns repository?It means that we received the notice on the indicated date,0
It does not mean that the content was unlawful or wrong,0
It does not mean that the user identified in the notice has done anything wrong,0
We don't make or imply any judgment about the merit of the claims they make,0
We post these notices and requests only for informational purposes,0
"Transparency reportingIn addition to posting government takedown notices in our gov-takedowns repository, we report on them in our transparency report",0
We also track and report in our transparency report on government takedowns based on violations of GitHub's Terms of Service,0
We process those violations as we would process a Terms of Service violation reported by anyone else,0
This guide describes the information that GitHub needs in order to process a DMCA takedown request,0
"If you have more general questions about what the DMCA is or how GitHub processes DMCA takedown requests, please review our DMCA Takedown Policy",0
"Due to the type of content GitHub hosts (mostly software code) and the way that content is managed (with Git), we need complaints to be as specific as possible",0
These guidelines are designed to make the processing of alleged infringement notices as straightforward as possible,0
"Our form of notice set forth below is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA statute, which can be found at the U",0
S,1
Copyright Office's official website: https://www,0

gov,0
"As with all legal matters, it is always best to consult with a professional about your specific questions or situation",0
We strongly encourage you to do so before taking any action that might impact your rights,0
This guide isn't legal advice and shouldn't be taken as such,0
Before You StartTell the Truth,0
The DMCA requires that you swear to the facts in your copyright complaint under penalty of perjury,0
It is a federal crime to intentionally lie in a sworn declaration,0
(See U,0
S,1
"Code, Title 18, Section 1621",0
") Submitting false information could also result in civil liability — that is, you could get sued for money damages",0
The DMCA itself provides for damages against any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing,0
Investigate,0
Millions of users and organizations pour their hearts and souls into the projects they create and contribute to on GitHub,0
Filing a DMCA complaint against such a project is a serious legal allegation that carries real consequences for real people,0
"Because of that, we ask that you conduct a thorough investigation and consult with an attorney before submitting a takedown to make sure that the use isn't actually permissible",0
Ask Nicely First,0
A great first step before sending us a takedown notice is to try contacting the user directly,0
"They may have listed contact information on their public profile page or in the repository's README, or you could get in touch by opening an issue or pull request on the repository",0
"This is not strictly required, but it is classy",0
Send In The Correct Request,0
"We can only accept DMCA takedown notices for works that are protected by copyright, and that identify a specific copyrightable work",0
"If you have a complaint about trademark abuse, please see our trademark policy",0
"If you wish to remove sensitive data such as passwords, please see our policy on sensitive data",0
"If you are dealing with defamation or other abusive behavior, please see our Community Guidelines",0
Code Is Different From Other Creative Content,0
GitHub is built for collaboration on software code,0
"This makes identifying a valid copyright infringement more complicated than it might otherwise be for, say, photos, music, or videos",0
There are a number of reasons why code is different from other creative content,0
"For instance:A repository may include bits and pieces of code from many different people, but only one file or even a sub-routine within a file infringes your copyrights",0
"Code mixes functionality with creative expression, but copyright only protects the expressive elements, not the parts that are functional",0
There are often licenses to consider,0
Just because a piece of code has a copyright notice does not necessarily mean that it is infringing,0
It is possible that the code is being used in accordance with an open-source license,0
"A particular use may be fair-use if it only uses a small amount of copyrighted content, uses that content in a transformative way, uses it for educational purposes, or some combination of the above",0
"Because code naturally lends itself to such uses, each use case is different and must be considered separately",1
"Code may be alleged to infringe in many different ways, requiring detailed explanations and identifications of works",0
"This list isn't exhaustive, which is why speaking to a legal professional about your proposed complaint is doubly important when dealing with code",0
No Bots,0
You should have a trained professional evaluate the facts of every takedown notice you send,0
"If you are outsourcing your efforts to a third party, make sure you know how they operate, and make sure they are not using automated bots to submit complaints in bulk",0
These complaints are often invalid and processing them results in needlessly taking down projects!Matters of Copyright Are Hard,0
It can be very difficult to determine whether or not a particular work is protected by copyright,0
"For example, facts (including data) are generally not copyrightable",0
Words and short phrases are generally not copyrightable,0
URLs and domain names are generally not copyrightable,0
"Since you can only use the DMCA process to target content that is protected by copyright, you should speak with a lawyer if you have questions about whether or not your content is protectable",0
You May Receive a Counter Notice,0
Any user affected by your takedown notice may decide to submit a counter notice,0
"If they do, we will re-enable their content within 10-14 days unless you notify us that you have initiated a legal action seeking to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content on GitHub",0
Your Complaint Will Be Published,0
"As noted in our DMCA Takedown Policy, after redacting personal information, we publish all complete and actionable takedown notices at https://github",0
com/github/dmca,0
GitHub Isn't The Judge,0
GitHub exercises little discretion in the process other than determining whether the notices meet the minimum requirements of the DMCA,0
"It is up to the parties (and their lawyers) to evaluate the merit of their claims, bearing in mind that notices must be made under penalty of perjury",0
Your Complaint Must,0
"Include the following statement: ""I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice",1
""" We won't refuse to process an otherwise complete complaint if you don't include this statement",1
But we'll know that you haven't read these guidelines and may ask you to go back and do so,1
Identify the copyrighted work you believe has been infringed,1
This information is important because it helps the affected user evaluate your claim and give them the ability to compare your work to theirs,1
The specificity of your identification will depend on the nature of the work you believe has been infringed,1
"If you have published your work, you might be able to just link back to a web page where it lives",1
"If it is proprietary and not published, you might describe it and explain that it is proprietary",1
"If you have registered it with the Copyright Office, you should include the registration number",1
"If you are alleging that the hosted content is a direct, literal copy of your work, you can also just explain that fact",1
"Identify the material that you allege is infringing the copyrighted work listed in item #2, above",1
It is important to be as specific as possible in your identification,1
This identification needs to be reasonably sufficient to permit GitHub to locate the material,1
"At a minimum, this means that you should include the URL to the material allegedly infringing your copyright",1
"If you allege that less than a whole repository infringes, identify the specific file(s) or line numbers within a file that you allege infringe",1
"If you allege that all of the content at a URL infringes, please be explicit about that as well",1
Please note that GitHub will not automatically disable forks when disabling a parent repository,1
"If you have investigated and analyzed the forks of a repository and believe that they are also infringing, please explicitly identify each allegedly infringing fork",1
Please also confirm that you have investigated each individual case and that your sworn statements apply to each identified fork,1
"In rare cases, you may be alleging copyright infringement in a full repository that is actively being forked",1
"If at the time that you submitted your notice, you identified all existing forks of that repository as allegedly infringing, we would process a valid claim against all forks in that network at the time we process the notice",1
We would do this given the likelihood that all newly created forks would contain the same content,1
"In addition, if the reported network that contains the allegedly infringing content is larger than one hundred (100) repositories and thus would be difficult to review in its entirety, we may consider disabling the entire network if you state in your notice that, ""Based on the representative number of forks you have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository",1
""" Your sworn statement would apply to this statement",1
Explain what the affected user would need to do in order to remedy the infringement,1
"Again, specificity is important",1
"When we pass your complaint along to the user, this will tell them what they need to do in order to avoid having the rest of their content disabled",1
"Does the user just need to add a statement of attribution? Do they need to delete certain lines within their code, or entire files? Of course, we understand that in some cases, all of a user's content may be alleged to infringe and there's nothing they could do short of deleting it all",1
"If that's the case, please make that clear as well",1
Provide your contact information,1
"Include your email address, name, telephone number and physical address",1
"Provide contact information, if you know it, for the alleged infringer",1
Usually this will be satisfied by providing the GitHub username associated with the allegedly infringing content,1
But there may be cases where you have additional knowledge about the alleged infringer,1
"If so, please share that information with us",1
"Include the following statement: ""I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law",1
I have taken fair use into consideration,1
"""Also include the following statement: ""I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed",0
"""Include your physical or electronic signature",0
Complaints about Anti-Circumvention TechnologyThe Copyright Act also prohibits the circumvention of technological measures that effectively control access to works protected by copyright,0
"If you believe that content hosted on GitHub violates this prohibition, please send us a report through our Copyright claims form, and include specific information about what content violates that prohibition, what technological measures you had in place, and why the content violates the prohibition",0
How to Submit Your ComplaintThe fastest way to get a response is to enter your information and answer all the questions on our Copyright claims form,0
You can also send an email notification to copyright@github,0
com,1
"You may include an attachment if you like, but please also include a plain-text version of your letter in the body of your message",0
"If you must send your notice by physical mail, you can do that too, but it will take substantially longer for us to receive and respond to it",0
Notices we receive via plain-text email have a much faster turnaround than PDF attachments or physical mail,0
"If you still wish to mail us your notice, our physical address is:GitHub, IncAttn: DMCA Agent88 Colin P Kelly Jr StSan Francisco, CA",0

Are you a law enforcement officer conducting an investigation that may involve user content hosted on GitHub?Or maybe you're a privacy-conscious person who would like to know what information we share with law enforcement and under what circumstances,0
"Either way, you're on the right page",0
"In these guidelines, we provide a little background about what GitHub is, the types of data we have, and the conditions under which we will disclose private user information",0
"Before we get into the details, however, here are a few important details you may want to know:We will notify affected users about any requests for their account information, unless prohibited from doing so by law or court order",0
"We will not disclose location-tracking data, such as IP address logs, without a valid court order or search warrant",0
"We will not disclose any private user content, including the contents of private repositories, without a valid search warrant",0
About these guidelinesOur users trust us with their software projects and code—often some of their most valuable business or personal assets,0
"Maintaining that trust is essential to us, which means keeping user data safe, secure, and private",0
"While the overwhelming majority of our users use GitHub's services to create new businesses, build new technologies, and for the general betterment of humankind, we recognize that with millions of users spread all over the world, there are bound to be a few bad apples in the bunch",0
"In those cases, we want to help law enforcement serve their legitimate interest in protecting the public",0
"By providing guidelines for law enforcement personnel, we hope to strike a balance between the often competing interests of user privacy and justice",0
"We hope these guidelines will help to set expectations on both sides, as well as to add transparency to GitHub's internal processes",0
Our users should know that we value their private information and that we do what we can to protect it,0
"At a minimum, this means only releasing data to third-parties when the appropriate legal requirements have been satisfied",0
"By the same token, we also hope to educate law enforcement professionals about GitHub's systems so that they can more efficiently tailor their data requests and target just that information needed to conduct their investigation",0
"GitHub terminologyBefore asking us to disclose data, it may be useful to understand how our system is implemented",0
GitHub hosts millions of data repositories using the Git version control system,0
"Repositories on GitHub—which may be public or private—are most commonly used for software development projects, but are also often used to work on content of all kinds",0
Users —Users are represented in our system as personal GitHub accounts,0
"Each user has a personal profile, and can own multiple repositories",0
Users can create or be invited to join organizations or to collaborate on another user's repository,0
Collaborators —A collaborator is a user with read and write access to a repository who has been invited to contribute by the repository owner,0
"Organizations —Organizations are a group of two or more users that typically mirror real-world organizations, such as businesses or projects",0
They are administered by users and can contain both repositories and teams of users,0
Repositories —A repository is one of the most basic GitHub elements,0
They may be easiest to imagine as a project's folder,0
"A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history",0
"Repositories can have multiple collaborators and, at its administrators' discretion, may be publicly viewable or not",0
Pages —GitHub Pages are public webpages freely hosted by GitHub that users can easily publish through code stored in their repositories,0
"If a user or organization has a GitHub Page, it can usually be found at a URL such as https://username",0
github,1
io or they may have the webpage mapped to their own custom domain name,0
Gists —Gists are snippets of source code or other text that users can use to store ideas or share with friends,0
"Like regular GitHub repositories, Gists are created with Git, so they are automatically versioned, forkable and downloadable",0
Gists can either be public or secret (accessible only through a known URL),0
Public Gists cannot be converted into secret Gists,0

We want to keep GitHub safe for everyone,0
"If you've discovered a security vulnerability in GitHub, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner",0
"Bounty ProgramLike several other large software companies, GitHub provides a bug bounty to better engage with security researchers",0
The idea is simple: hackers and security researchers (like you) find and report vulnerabilities through our responsible disclosure process,0
"Then, to recognize the significant effort that these researchers often put forth when hunting down bugs, we reward them with some cold hard cash",0
"Check out the GitHub Bug Bounty site for bounty details, review our comprehensive Legal Safe Harbor Policy terms as well, and happy hunting!",0
"SummaryWe want you to responsibly disclose through our bug bounty program, and don't want researchers put in fear of legal consequences because of their good faith attempts to comply with our bug bounty policy",0
"We cannot bind any third party, so do not assume this protection extends to any third party",1
"If in doubt, ask us before engaging in any specific action you think might go outside the bounds of our policy",1
"Because both identifying and non-identifying information can put a researcher at risk, we limit what we share with third parties",1
"We may provide non-identifying substantive information from your report to an affected third party, but only after notifying you and receiving a commitment that the third party will not pursue legal action against you",1
"We will only share identifying information (name, email address, phone number, etc",1

"Please understand that if your security research involves the networks, systems, information, applications, products, or services of a third party (which is not us), we cannot bind that third party, and they may pursue legal action or law enforcement notice",0
"We cannot and do not authorize security research in the name of other entities, and cannot in any way offer to defend, indemnify, or otherwise protect you from any third party action based on your actions",0
"You are expected, as always, to comply with all laws applicable to you, and not to disrupt or compromise any data beyond what this bug bounty program permits",0
Please contact us before engaging in conduct that may be inconsistent with or unaddressed by this policy,0

"We offer this private information removal process as an exceptional service only for high-risk content that violates GitHub's Terms of Service, such as when your security is at risk from exposed access credentials",0
This guide describes the information GitHub needs from you in order to process a request to remove private information from a repository,0
"What is Private Information?For the purposes of this document, “private information” refers to content that (i) should have been kept confidential, and (ii) whose public availability poses a specific or targeted security risk to you or your organization",0
"""Security risk"" refers to a situation involving exposure to physical danger, identity theft, or increased likelihood of unauthorized access to physical or network facilities",0
"Private information removal requests are appropriate for:Access credentials, such as user names combined with passwords, access tokens, or other sensitive secrets that can grant access to your organization's server, network, or domain",0
AWS tokens and other similar access credentials that grant access to a third party on your behalf,0
You must be able to show that the token does belong to you,0
Documentation (such as network diagrams or architecture) that poses a specific security risk for an organization,0
"Information related to, and posing a security risk to, you as an individual (such as social security numbers or other government identification numbers)",0
"Private information removal requests are not appropriate for:Internal server names, IP addresses, and URLs, on their own",0
You must be able to show that their use in a particular file or piece of code poses a security threat,0
"Mere mentions of your company's identity, name, brand, domain name, or other references to your company in files on GitHub",0
You must be able to articulate why a use of your company's identity is a threat to your company's security posture,0
"Entire files or repositories that do not pose a specific security risk, but you believe are otherwise objectionable",0
Requests to remove content that may infringe your or your organization's copyright rights,0
"If you have questions about how GitHub handles copyright-related matters or would like to report potentially infringing content, please review our DMCA Takedown Policy",0
The private information removal process is generally not intended for the removal of full files or repositories — only for the specific pieces of private information in those files,0
"While there may be cases where files are filled entirely with private information, you must justify the security risk for the removal of such files, and this may increase the time required to process your request",0
Trademark disputes,0
"If you have questions about how GitHub handles trademark-related matters or would like to report content containing your organization's trade or service marks, please review our Trademark Policy",0
Privacy complaints,0
"If you wish to access, transfer, change, or delete your personal information on GitHub, please contact us via our Privacy contact form",0
"Content governed by our Community Guidelines, such as malware or general-purpose tools",0
"If you have questions about our Community Guidelines or believe that content on GitHub might violate our guidelines, you can use Report content to contact us",0
Things to KnowAsk Nicely First,0
A great first step before sending us a request to remove data is to try contacting the user directly,0
"They may have listed contact information on their public profile page or in the repository's README or Support file, or you could get in touch by creating an issue or pull request in the repository",0
"This is not strictly required, but it is appreciated",0
No Bots,0
You should have a trained professional evaluate the facts of every request you send,0
"If you're outsourcing your efforts to a third party, make sure you know how they operate, and make sure they are not using automated bots to submit complaints in bulk",0
"These complaints often include data that does not pose any security threats, and they do not include sufficient explanations, requiring additional back-and-forth and resulting in delays, even when the complaint is valid",0
Send In The Correct Request,0
"As noted above, we offer this private information removal process as an exceptional service only for high-risk content",0
"We are not able to use this process to remove other kinds of content, such as potentially infringing content, and we are not able to process any other kinds of removal requests simultaneously while processing private information removal requests",0
We will be able to help you more quickly if you send in your private information removal requests separately from any requests to remove potentially infringing content,0
"If you are unsure whether your request involves only private information or also involves other legal matters, please consult legal counsel",0
Processing Time,0
"While we do process private information removal requests as quickly as possible, due to the volume of requests we process, it may take some time for your request to be reviewed",0
"Additional requests, or multiple requests from additional points of contact, may result in delays",0
How Does This Actually Work?Complainant Investigates,0
"It is up to the requesting party to conduct their own investigation and to provide us with the details we require — most importantly, an explanation of how the data poses a security risk",1
GitHub is not in a position to search for or make initial determinations about private information on any individual's or organization's behalf,1
Complainant Sends a Private Information Removal Request,1
"After conducting an investigation, the complainant prepares and sends a private information removal request to GitHub",1
"If the request is not sufficiently detailed to demonstrate the security risk and for GitHub to locate the data, we will reply and ask for more information",1
GitHub Asks User to Make Changes,1
"In most cases, we will contact the user who created the repository and give them an opportunity to delete or modify the private information specified in the request or to dispute the claim",1
User Notifies GitHub of Changes,1
"If the user chooses to make the specified changes, they must tell us so within the window of time they've been allowed",1
"If they don't, we will disable the repository",1
"If the user notifies us that they made changes, we will verify that the changes have been made and notify the complainant",1
ORUser May Dispute the Request,0
"If a user believes the content in question is not private information subject to this Policy, they may dispute it",1
"If they do, we will generally leave it up to the complainant to contact the user and work things out with them directly, within reason",1
Complainant Reviews Changes,1
"If the user makes changes, the complainant must review them",1
"If the changes are insufficient, the complainant must provide GitHub with details explaining why",1
GitHub may disable the repository or give the user an additional chance to make the changes,1
User May Request an Additional Window to Make Changes,1
"If the user missed their opportunity to remove the private information specified in the notice, we may allow them an additional window of approximately 1 business day, upon request, to make those changes",1
"In that event, GitHub will notify the complainant",1
"What About Forks? (or What's a Fork?)One of the best features of GitHub is the ability for users to ""fork"" one another's repositories",0
"What does that mean? In essence, it means that users can make a copy of a project on GitHub into their own repositories",0
"As the license or the law allows, users can then make changes to that fork to either push back to the main project or just keep as their own variation of a project",0
"Each of these copies is a ""fork"" of the original repository, which in turn may also be called the ""parent"" of the fork",0
GitHub will not automatically disable forks when disabling a parent repository,0
This is because forks belong to different users and may have been altered in significant ways,0
GitHub does not conduct any independent investigation into forks,0
"We expect those sending private information removal requests to conduct that investigation and, if they believe that the forks also contain private information, expressly include forks in their request",0
"If at the time that you submitted your notice, you identified all existing forks of that repository, we would process a valid claim against all forks in that network at the time we process the notice",0
We would do this given the likelihood that all newly created forks would contain the same content,1
"In addition, if the reported network that contains the reported content is larger than one hundred (100) repositories and thus would be difficult to review in its entirety, we may consider disabling the entire network if you state in your notice that, based on the representative number of forks you have reviewed, you believe that all or most of the forks contain the content reported in the parent repository",0
"Sending A Private Information Removal RequestDue to the type of content GitHub hosts (mostly software code) and the way that content is managed (with Git), we need complaints to be as specific as possible",0
"In order for us to verify that a user has removed reported private information completely, we need to know exactly where to look",0
These guidelines are designed to make the processing of requests to remove private information as straightforward as possible,0
"Your Request Must Include:A working, clickable link to each file containing private information",0
"(Note that we're not able to work from search results, examples, or screenshots",1
)Specific line numbers within each file containing the private information,0
A brief description of how each item you've identified poses a security risk to you or your organization,1
It is important that you provide an explanation of how the data poses a security risk beyond merely stating that it does,1
"If you are a third party acting as an agent for an organization facing a security risk, include a statement that you have a legal right to act on behalf of that organization",1
"OPTIONAL: Let us know if your request is particularly urgent, and why",1
We respond to all private information removal requests as quickly as possible,1
"However, if this request is especially time-sensitive, such as a very recent credential exposure, please explain why",1
How to Submit Your RequestYou can submit your request to remove private information via our contact form,0
Please include a plain-text version of your request in the body of your message,0
Sending your request in an attachment may result in processing delays,0
"DisputesIf you received a private information removal request from us, you can dispute it by replying to our email and letting us know — in as much detail as possible — why you think the content in question is not private information subject to this Policy",0
"What is a GitHub Trademark Policy Violation?Using a company or business name, logo, or other trademark-protected materials in a manner that may mislead or confuse others with regard to its brand or business affiliation may be considered a trademark policy violation",0
What is not a GitHub Trademark Policy Violation?Using another's trademark in a way that has nothing to do with the product or service for which the trademark was granted is not a trademark policy violation,0
"GitHub user names are available on a first come, first served basis and may not be reserved",0
"A GitHub account with a user name that happens to be the same as a registered trademark is not, by itself, necessarily a violation of our trademark policy",0
"How Does GitHub Respond To Reported Trademark Policy Violations?When we receive reports of trademark policy violations from holders of federal or international trademark registrations, we review the account and may take the following actions:When there is a clear intent to mislead others through the unauthorized use of a trademark, GitHub will suspend the account and notify the account holder",0
"When we determine that an account appears to be confusing users, but is not purposefully passing itself off as the trademarked good or service, we give the account holder an opportunity to clear up any potential confusion",0
We may also release a username for the trademark holder's active use,0
How Do I Report a Trademark Policy Violation?Holders of registered trademarks can report possible trademark policy violations to GitHub via our contact form,0

This guide describes the information that GitHub needs in order to process a counter notice to a DMCA takedown request,0
"If you have more general questions about what the DMCA is or how GitHub processes DMCA takedown requests, please review our DMCA Takedown Policy",0
"If you believe your content on GitHub was mistakenly disabled by a DMCA takedown request, you have the right to contest the takedown by submitting a counter notice",0
"If you do, we will wait 10-14 days and then re-enable your content unless the copyright owner initiates a legal action against you before then",0
"Our counter-notice form, set forth below, is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA statute, which can be found at the U",0

"As with all legal matters, it is always best to consult with a professional about your specific questions or situation",0
We strongly encourage you to do so before taking any action that might impact your rights,0
This guide isn't legal advice and shouldn't be taken as such,0
Before You StartTell the Truth,0
The DMCA requires that you swear to your counter notice under penalty of perjury,0
It is a federal crime to intentionally lie in a sworn declaration,0
(See U,0
S,1
"Code, Title 18, Section 1621",0
") Submitting false information could also result in civil liability—that is, you could get sued for money damages",0
Investigate,0
Submitting a DMCA counter notice can have real legal consequences,0
"If the complaining party disagrees that their takedown notice was mistaken, they might decide to file a lawsuit against you to keep the content disabled",0
You should conduct a thorough investigation into the allegations made in the takedown notice and probably talk to a lawyer before submitting a counter notice,0
You Must Have a Good Reason to Submit a Counter Notice,0
"In order to file a counter notice, you must have ""a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled",0
""" (U",0
S,1
"Code, Title 17, Section 512(g)",0
") Whether you decide to explain why you believe there was a mistake is up to you and your lawyer, but you do need to identify a mistake before you submit a counter notice",0
"In the past, we have received counter notices citing mistakes in the takedown notice such as: the complaining party doesn't have the copyright; I have a license; the code has been released under an open-source license that permits my use; or the complaint doesn't account for the fact that my use is protected by the fair-use doctrine",0
"Of course, there could be other defects with the takedown notice",0
Copyright Laws Are Complicated,0
Sometimes a takedown notice might allege infringement in a way that seems odd or indirect,0
Copyright laws are complicated and can lead to some unexpected results,0
In some cases a takedown notice might allege that your source code infringes because of what it can do after it is compiled and run,0
For example:The notice may claim that your software is used to circumvent access controls to copyrighted works,0
"Sometimes distributing software can be copyright infringement, if you induce end users to use the software to infringe copyrighted works",0
"A copyright complaint might also be based on non-literal copying of design elements in the software, rather than the source code itself — in other words, someone has sent a notice saying they think your design looks too similar to theirs",0
These are just a few examples of the complexities of copyright law,0
"Since there are many nuances to the law and some unsettled questions in these types of cases, it is especially important to get professional advice if the infringement allegations do not seem straightforward",0
A Counter Notice Is A Legal Statement,0
"We require you to fill out all fields of a counter notice completely, because a counter notice is a legal statement — not just to us, but to the complaining party",0
"As we mentioned above, if the complaining party wishes to keep the content disabled after receiving a counter notice, they will need to initiate a legal action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content on GitHub",0
"In other words, you might get sued (and you consent to that in the counter notice)",0
Your Counter Notice Will Be Published,0
"As noted in our DMCA Takedown Policy, after redacting personal information, we publish all complete and actionable counter notices at https://github",0
com/github/dmca,0
"Please also note that, although we will only publicly publish redacted notices, we may provide a complete unredacted copy of any notices we receive directly to any party whose rights would be affected by it",0
"If you are concerned about your privacy, you may have a lawyer or other legal representative file the counter notice on your behalf",0
GitHub Isn't The Judge,0
GitHub exercises little discretion in this process other than determining whether the notices meet the minimum requirements of the DMCA,0
"It is up to the parties (and their lawyers) to evaluate the merit of their claims, bearing in mind that notices must be made under penalty of perjury",0
Additional Resources,0
"If you need additional help, there are many self-help resources online",0
Lumen has an informative set of guides on copyright and DMCA safe harbor,0
"If you are involved with an open-source project in need of legal advice, you can contact the Software Freedom Law Center",0
"And if you think you have a particularly challenging case, non-profit organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation may also be willing to help directly or refer you to a lawyer",0
Your Counter Notice Must,0
"Include the following statement: ""I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice",1
"""We won't refuse to process an otherwise complete counter notice if you don't include this statement; however, we will know that you haven't read these guidelines and may ask you to go back and do so",1
Identify the content that was disabled and the location where it appeared,1
The disabled content should have been identified by URL in the takedown notice,1
You simply need to copy the URL(s) that you want to challenge,1
Provide your contact information,1
"Include your email address, name, telephone number, and physical address",1
"Include the following statement: ""I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled",1
"""You may also choose to communicate the reasons why you believe there was a mistake or misidentification",1
"If you think of your counter notice as a ""note"" to the complaining party, this is a chance to explain why they should not take the next step and file a lawsuit in response",1
This is yet another reason to work with a lawyer when submitting a counter notice,1
"Include the following statement: ""I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person",1
"""Include your physical or electronic signature",0
How to Submit Your Counter NoticeThe fastest way to get a response is to enter your information and answer all the questions on our Copyright claims form,0
You can also send an email notification to copyright@github,0
com,1
"You may include an attachment if you like, but please also include a plain-text version of your letter in the body of your message",0
"If you must send your notice by physical mail, you can do that too, but it will take substantially longer for us to receive and respond to it—and the 10-14 day waiting period starts from when we receive your counter notice",0
Notices we receive via plain-text email have a much faster turnaround than PDF attachments or physical mail,0

"(If you just want to submit a notice, you can skip to the end",0
")As with all legal matters, it is always best to consult with a professional about your specific questions or situation",0
We strongly encourage you to do so before taking any action that might impact your rights,0
This guide isn't legal advice and shouldn't be taken as such,0
"What Is the DMCA?In order to understand the DMCA and some of the policy lines it draws, it's perhaps helpful to consider life before it was enacted",0
The DMCA provides a safe harbor for service providers that host user-generated content,0
"Since even a single claim of copyright infringement can carry statutory damages of up to $150,000, the possibility of being held liable for user-generated content could be very harmful for service providers",0
"With potential damages multiplied across millions of users, cloud-computing and user-generated content sites like YouTube, Facebook, or GitHub probably never would have existed without the DMCA (or at least not without passing some of that cost downstream to their users)",0
The DMCA addresses this issue by creating a copyright liability safe harbor for internet service providers hosting allegedly infringing user-generated content,0
"Essentially, so long as a service provider follows the DMCA's notice-and-takedown rules, it won't be liable for copyright infringement based on user-generated content",0
"Because of this, it is important for GitHub to maintain its DMCA safe-harbor status",0
"DMCA Notices In a NutshellThe DMCA provides two simple, straightforward procedures that all GitHub users should know about: (i) a takedown-notice procedure for copyright holders to request that content be removed; and (ii) a counter-notice procedure for users to get content reenabled when content is taken down by mistake or misidentification",0
DMCA takedown notices are used by copyright owners to ask GitHub to take down content they believe to be infringing,0
"If you are a software designer or developer, you create copyrighted content every day",0
"If someone else is using your copyrighted content in an unauthorized manner on GitHub, you can send us a DMCA takedown notice to request that the infringing content be changed or removed",0
"On the other hand, counter notices can be used to correct mistakes",0
Maybe the person sending the takedown notice does not hold the copyright or did not realize that you have a license or made some other mistake in their takedown notice,0
"Since GitHub usually cannot know if there has been a mistake, the DMCA counter notice allows you to let us know and ask that we put the content back up",0
The DMCA notice and takedown process should be used only for complaints about copyright infringement,0
Notices sent through our DMCA process must identify copyrighted work or works that are allegedly being infringed,0
"The process cannot be used for other complaints, such as complaints about alleged trademark infringement or sensitive data; we offer separate processes for those situations",0
A,0
How Does This Actually Work?The DMCA framework is a bit like passing notes in class,0
The copyright owner hands GitHub a complaint about a user,0
"If it's written correctly, we pass the complaint along to the user",0
"If the user disputes the complaint, they can pass a note back saying so",0
GitHub exercises little discretion in the process other than determining whether the notices meet the minimum requirements of the DMCA,0
"It is up to the parties (and their lawyers) to evaluate the merit of their claims, bearing in mind that notices must be made under penalty of perjury",0
Here are the basic steps in the process,0
Copyright Owner Investigates,1
A copyright owner should always conduct an initial investigation to confirm both (a) that they own the copyright to an original work and (b) that the content on GitHub is unauthorized and infringing,1
This includes confirming that the use is not protected as fair use,1
"A particular use may be fair if it only uses a small amount of copyrighted content, uses that content in a transformative way, uses it for educational purposes, or some combination of the above",1
"Because code naturally lends itself to such uses, each use case is different and must be considered separately",1
Example: An employee of Acme Web Company finds some of the company's code in a GitHub repository,1
Acme Web Company licenses its source code out to several trusted partners,1
"Before sending in a take-down notice, Acme should review those licenses and its agreements to confirm that the code on GitHub is not authorized under any of them",1
Copyright Owner Sends A Notice,1
"After conducting an investigation, a copyright owner prepares and sends a takedown notice to GitHub",1
"Assuming the takedown notice is sufficiently detailed according to the statutory requirements (as explained in the how-to guide), we will post the notice to our public repository and pass the link along to the affected user",1
GitHub Asks User to Make Changes,1
"If the notice alleges that the entire contents of a repository infringe, or a package infringes, we will skip to Step 6 and disable the entire repository or package expeditiously",1
"Otherwise, because GitHub cannot disable access to specific files within a repository, we will contact the user who created the repository and give them approximately 1 business day to delete or modify the content specified in the notice",1
We'll notify the copyright owner if and when we give the user a chance to make changes,1
"Because packages are immutable, if only part of a package is infringing, GitHub would need to disable the entire package, but we permit reinstatement once the infringing portion is removed",1
User Notifies GitHub of Changes,1
"If the user chooses to make the specified changes, they must tell us so within the window of approximately 1 business day",1
"If they don't, we will disable the repository (as described in Step 6)",1
"If the user notifies us that they made changes, we will verify that the changes have been made and then notify the copyright owner",1
Copyright Owner Revises or Retracts the Notice,1
"If the user makes changes, the copyright owner must review them and renew or revise their takedown notice if the changes are insufficient",1
GitHub will not take any further action unless the copyright owner contacts us to either renew the original takedown notice or submit a revised one,1
"If the copyright owner is satisfied with the changes, they may either submit a formal retraction or else do nothing",1
GitHub will interpret silence longer than two weeks as an implied retraction of the takedown notice,1
GitHub May Disable Access to the Content,1
GitHub will disable a user's content if: (i) the copyright owner has alleged copyright over the user's entire repository or package (as noted in Step 3); (ii) the user has not made any changes after being given an opportunity to do so (as noted in Step 4); or (iii) the copyright owner has renewed their takedown notice after the user had a chance to make changes,1
"If the copyright owner chooses instead to revise the notice, we will go back to Step 2 and repeat the process as if the revised notice were a new notice",1
User May Send A Counter Notice,1
We encourage users who have had content disabled to consult with a lawyer about their options,1
"If a user believes that their content was disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification, they may send us a counter notice",1
"As with the original notice, we will make sure that the counter notice is sufficiently detailed (as explained in the how-to guide)",1
"If it is, we will post it to our public repository and pass the notice back to the copyright owner by sending them the link",1
Copyright Owner May File a Legal Action,1
"If a copyright owner wishes to keep the content disabled after receiving a counter notice, they will need to initiate a legal action seeking a court order to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content on GitHub",1
"In other words, you might get sued",1
"If the copyright owner does not give GitHub notice within 10-14 days, by sending a copy of a valid legal complaint filed in a court of competent jurisdiction, GitHub will reenable the disabled content",1
B,0
"What About Forks? (or What's a Fork?)One of the best features of GitHub is the ability for users to ""fork"" one another's repositories",0
"What does that mean? In essence, it means that users can make a copy of a project on GitHub into their own repositories",0
"As the license or the law allows, users can then make changes to that fork to either push back to the main project or just keep as their own variation of a project",0
"Each of these copies is a ""fork"" of the original repository, which in turn may also be called the ""parent"" of the fork",0
GitHub will not automatically disable forks when disabling a parent repository,0
"This is because forks belong to different users, may have been altered in significant ways, and may be licensed or used in a different way that is protected by the fair-use doctrine",0
GitHub does not conduct any independent investigation into forks,0
"We expect copyright owners to conduct that investigation and, if they believe that the forks are also infringing, expressly include forks in their takedown notice",0
"In rare cases, you may be alleging copyright infringement in a full repository that is actively being forked",1
"If at the time that you submitted your notice, you identified all existing forks of that repository as allegedly infringing, we would process a valid claim against all forks in that network at the time we process the notice",1
We would do this given the likelihood that all newly created forks would contain the same content,1
"In addition, if the reported network that contains the allegedly infringing content is larger than one hundred (100) repositories and thus would be difficult to review in its entirety, we may consider disabling the entire network if you state in your notice that, ""Based on the representative number of forks you have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository",1
""" Your sworn statement would apply to this statement",1
C,0
What If I Inadvertently Missed the Window to Make Changes?We recognize that there are many valid reasons that you may not be able to make changes within the window of approximately 1 business day we provide before your repository gets disabled,0
"Maybe our message got flagged as spam, maybe you were on vacation, maybe you don't check that email account regularly, or maybe you were just busy",0
We get it,0
"If you respond to let us know that you would have liked to make the changes, but somehow missed the first opportunity, we will re-enable the repository one additional time for approximately 1 business day to allow you to make the changes",0
"Again, you must notify us that you have made the changes in order to keep the repository enabled after that window of approximately 1 business day, as noted above in Step A",0
4,0
Please note that we will only provide this one additional chance,0
D,0
TransparencyWe believe that transparency is a virtue,0
The public should know what content is being removed from GitHub and why,0
An informed public can notice and surface potential issues that would otherwise go unnoticed in an opaque system,0
"We post redacted copies of any legal notices we receive (including original notices, counter notices or retractions) at https://github",0
com/github/dmca,0
We will not publicly publish your personal contact information; we will remove personal information (except for usernames in URLs) before publishing notices,0
"We will not, however, redact any other information from your notice unless you specifically ask us to",0
Here are some examples of a published notice and counter notice for you to see what they look like,0
"When we remove content, we will post a link to the related notice in its place",0
"Please also note that, although we will not publicly publish unredacted notices, we may provide a complete unredacted copy of any notices we receive directly to any party whose rights would be affected by it",0
E,0
"Repeated InfringementIt is the policy of GitHub, in appropriate circumstances and in its sole discretion, to disable and terminate the accounts of users who may infringe upon the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of GitHub or others",0

"While GitHub acknowledges and appreciates the important role that the DMCA has played in promoting innovation online, we believe that the copyright laws could probably use a patch or two—if not a whole new release",0
"In software, we are constantly improving and updating our code",0

"For the purposes of Article 46(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection, Customer (as data exporter) and GitHub (as data importer, whose signature appears below), each a “party,” together “the parties,” have agreed on the following Contractual Clauses (the “Clauses” or “Standard Contractual Clauses”) in order to adduce adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals for the transfer by the data exporter to the data importer of the personal data specified in Appendix 1",0
"Clause 1: Definitions(a) 'personal data', 'special categories of data', 'process/processing', 'controller', 'processor', 'data subject' and 'supervisory authority' shall have the same meaning as in the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data;(b) 'the data exporter' means the controller who transfers the personal data;(c) 'the data importer' means the processor who agrees to receive from the data exporter personal data intended for processing on his behalf after the transfer in accordance with his instructions and the terms of the Clauses and who is not subject to a third country's system ensuring adequate protection within the meaning of Article 45(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679);(d) 'the subprocessor' means any processor engaged by the data importer or by any other subprocessor of the data importer who agrees to receive from the data importer or from any other subprocessor of the data importer personal data exclusively intended for processing activities to be carried out on behalf of the data exporter after the transfer in accordance with his instructions, the terms of the Clauses and the terms of the written subcontract;(e) 'the applicable data protection law' means the legislation protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and, in particular, their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data applicable to a data controller in the Member State in which the data exporter is established;(f) 'technical and organisational security measures' means those measures aimed at protecting personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing",0
Clause 2: Details of the transferThe details of the transfer and in particular the special categories of personal data where applicable are specified in Appendix 1 below which forms an integral part of the Clauses,0

"The data subject can enforce against the subprocessor this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity",1
Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses,1
The parties do not object to a data subject being represented by an association or other body if the data subject so expressly wishes and if permitted by national law,1
"Clause 4: Obligations of the data exporterThe data exporter agrees and warrants:(a) that the processing, including the transfer itself, of the personal data has been and will continue to be carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of the applicable data protection law (and, where applicable, has been notified to the relevant authorities of the Member State where the data exporter is established) and does not violate the relevant provisions of that State;(b) that it has instructed and throughout the duration of the personal data processing services will instruct the data importer to process the personal data transferred only on the data exporter's behalf and in accordance with the applicable data protection law and the Clauses;(c) that the data importer will provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 below;(d) that after assessment of the requirements of the applicable data protection law, the security measures are appropriate to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing, and that these measures ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected having regard to the state of the art and the cost of their implementation;(e) that it will ensure compliance with the security measures;(f) that, if the transfer involves special categories of data, the data subject has been informed or will be informed before, or as soon as possible after, the transfer that its data could be transmitted to a third country not providing adequate protection within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679);(g) to forward any notification received from the data importer or any subprocessor pursuant to Clause 5(b) and Clause 8(3) to the data protection supervisory authority if the data exporter decides to continue the transfer or to lift the suspension;(h) to make available to the data subjects upon request a copy of the Clauses, with the exception of Appendix 2, and a summary description of the security measures, as well as a copy of any contract for subprocessing services which has to be made in accordance with the Clauses, unless the Clauses or the contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information;(i) that, in the event of subprocessing, the processing activity is carried out in accordance with Clause 11 by a subprocessor providing at least the same level of protection for the personal data and the rights of data subject as the data importer under the Clauses; and(j) that it will ensure compliance with Clause 4(a) to (i)",0
"Clause 5: Obligations of the data importerThe data importer agrees and warrants:(a) to process the personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in compliance with its instructions and the Clauses; if it cannot provide such compliance for whatever reasons, it agrees to inform promptly the data exporter of its inability to comply, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;(b) that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable to it prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under the contract and that in the event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations provided by the Clauses, it will promptly notify the change to the data exporter as soon as it is aware, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;(c) that it has implemented the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 before processing the personal data transferred;(d) that it will promptly notify the data exporter about:(i) any legally binding request for disclosure of the personal data by a law enforcement authority unless otherwise prohibited, such as a prohibition under criminal law to preserve the confidentiality of a law enforcement investigation,(ii) any accidental or unauthorised access, and(iii) any request received directly from the data subjects without responding to that request, unless it has been otherwise authorised to do so;(e) to deal promptly and properly with all inquiries from the data exporter relating to its processing of the personal data subject to the transfer and to abide by the advice of the supervisory authority with regard to the processing of the data transferred;(f) at the request of the data exporter to submit its data processing facilities for audit of the processing activities covered by the Clauses which shall be carried out by the data exporter or an inspection body composed of independent members and in possession of the required professional qualifications bound by a duty of confidentiality, selected by the data exporter, where applicable, in agreement with the supervisory authority;(g) to make available to the data subject upon request a copy of the Clauses, or any existing contract for subprocessing, unless the Clauses or contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information, with the exception of Appendix 2 which shall be replaced by a summary description of the security measures in those cases where the data subject is unable to obtain a copy from the data exporter;(h) that, in the event of subprocessing, it has previously informed the data exporter and obtained its prior written consent;(i) that the processing services by the subprocessor will be carried out in accordance with Clause 11; and(j) to send promptly a copy of any subprocessor agreement it concludes under the Clauses to the data exporter",0
Clause 6: LiabilityThe parties agree that any data subject who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or subprocessor is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered,0
"If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract of by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity",1

"If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the subprocessor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data subprocessor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity",1
The liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses,1

Clause 9: Governing Law,0
The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established,0

Clause 11: SubprocessingThe data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter,0
"Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses",1
Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the subprocessor's obligations under such agreement,1
The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law,1
Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses,1

About licensing for GitHub Advanced SecurityIf you want to use GitHub Advanced Security features on any repository apart from a public repository on GitHub,0
"com, you will need a license",0
"For more information about GitHub Advanced Security, see ""About GitHub Advanced Security",0
"""Each license for GitHub Advanced Security specifies a maximum number of accounts, or seats, that can use these features",0
Each active committer to at least one repository with the feature enabled uses one seat,0
An active committer is someone who authored at least one commit that was pushed to the repository in the last 90 days,0
"To discuss licensing GitHub Advanced Security for your enterprise account, contact GitHub's Sales team",0
About committer numbers for GitHub Advanced SecurityWe record and display two numbers of committers for GitHub Advanced Security on GitHub,0
com:Committers is the number of committers who contributed to at least one private repository in an organization and who use a seat in your license,0
"That is, they are also an organization member, an external collaborator, or have a pending invitation to join an organization in your enterprise",0
"Unique to this repository/organization is the number of committers who contributed only to this repository, or to repositories in this organization",0
This number shows how many license seats you can free up by disabling GitHub Advanced Security for that repository or organization,0
"If there are no unique committers, this means that all active committers also contribute to other repositories or organizations that use GitHub Advanced Security",0
Disabling the feature for that repository or organization would not free any seats on your license,0
Note: The total number of seats used in your license is not the sum of either the committers or the unique committers to each repository or organization,0
This is because there are people who contribute to multiple repositories or organizations,0
The number of seats used is measured across the whole enterprise account to ensure that each person is counted only once regardless of how many repositories or organizations they contribute to,0
"Managing your license usage for GitHub Advanced SecurityWhen you enable GitHub Advanced Security for a single repository, or for all repositories in an organization, GitHub shows how many extra seats this will use and prompts you for confirmation",0
"If you disable access to GitHub Advanced Security, any seats used by ""unique"" committers are freed up",0
This makes it easy to understand the impact of your changes on the use of your license,0
"If you are over your license limit, GitHub Advanced Security continues to work on all repositories where it is already enabled",0
"However, in organizations where GitHub Advanced Security is enabled for new repositories, repositories will be created with the feature disabled",0
"In addition, the option to enable GitHub Advanced Security for existing repositories will not be available",0
If you change the visibility of a public repository to private then GitHub Advanced Security will be disabled for that repository,0
"As soon as you free up some seats, by disabling GitHub Advanced Security for some repositories or by increasing your license size, the options for enabling GitHub Advanced Security will work again as normal",0
You can enforce policies to allow or disallow the use of Advanced Security by organizations owned by your enterprise account,0

About reverting a pull requestReverting a pull request on GitHub creates a new pull request that contains one revert of the merge commit from the original merged pull request,0
Reverting a pull requestNote: You may need to revert the individual commits in your pull request if either of the following is true,0
Reverting the pull request causes merge conflictsThe original pull request was not originally merged on GitHub,0

The history for a single file may omit commits found on the repository's commit history,0
Git has several different ways of showing the history of a repository,0
"When Git shows the history of a single file, it simplifies history by omittingcommits that did not change the file",0
"Instead of looking at every commit todecide whether it touched the file, Git will omit a whole branch if that branch,when merged, did not impact the final contents of the file",0
Any commits on thebranch that touched the file will not be shown,0
"For a file's commit history, GitHub explicitly follows this simple strategy",0
It makes the history simpler by removing commits that didn't contribute to the final result,0
"For example, if a side branch made a change and then reverted it, that commit would not show up in the branch history",0
"This makes reviewing branches more efficient, since you only see the commits that affect the file",0

"When you create a pull request, GitHub identifies the most recent commit that is on both the head branch and the base branch: the common ancestor commit",0
"When you squash and merge the pull request, GitHub creates a commit on the base branch that contains all of the changes you made on the head branch since the common ancestor commit",0
"Because this commit is only on the base branch and not the head branch, the common ancestor of the two branches remains unchanged",0
"If you continue to work on the head branch, then create a new pull request between the two branches, the pull request will include all of the commits since the common ancestor, including commits that you squashed and merged in the previous pull request",0
"If there are no conflicts, you can safely merge these commits",0
"However, this workflow makes merge conflicts more likely",0
"If you continue to squash and merge pull requests for a long-running head branch, you will have to resolve the same conflicts repeatedly",0
"Rebase and merge your pull request commitsWhen you select the Rebase and merge option on a pull request on GitHub, all commits from the topic branch (or head branch) are added onto the base branch individually without a merge commit",0
Pull requests with rebased commits are merged using the fast-forward option,0
"To rebase and merge pull requests, you must have write permissions in the repository, and the repository must allow rebase merging",0
The rebase and merge behavior on GitHub deviates slightly from git rebase,0
"Rebase and merge on GitHub will always update the committer information and create new commit SHAs, whereas git rebase outside of GitHub does not change the committer information when the rebase happens on top of an ancestor commit",0
"For more information about git rebase, see the official Git documentation",0
"For a visual representation of git rebase, see The ""Git Branching - Rebasing"" chapter from the Pro Git book",0
You aren't able to automatically rebase and merge on GitHub when:The pull request has merge conflicts,0
Rebasing the commits from the base branch into the head branch runs into conflicts,0
"Rebasing the commits is considered ""unsafe,"" such as when a rebase is possible without merge conflicts but would produce a different result than a merge would",0
If you still want to rebase the commits but can't rebase and merge automatically on GitHub you must:Rebase the topic branch (or head branch) onto the base branch locally on the command lineResolve any merge conflicts on the command line,0

"Typically, you would use git rebase to:Edit previous commit messagesCombine multiple commits into oneDelete or revert commits that are no longer necessaryWarning: Because changing your commit history can make things difficult for everyone else using the repository, it's considered bad practice to rebase commits when you've already pushed to a repository",0
"To learn how to safely rebase on GitHub, see ""About pull request merges",0
"""Rebasing commits against a branchTo rebase all the commits between another branch and the current branch state, you can enter the following command in your shell (either the command prompt for Windows, or the terminal for Mac and Linux):$ git rebase --interactive other_branch_nameRebasing commits against a point in timeTo rebase the last few commits in your current branch, you can enter the following command in your shell:$ git rebase --interactive HEAD~7Commands available while rebasingThere are six commands available while rebasing:pickpick simply means that the commit is included",0
Rearranging the order of the pick commands changes the order of the commits when the rebase is underway,0
"If you choose not to include a commit, you should delete the entire line",0
"rewordThe reword command is similar to pick, but after you use it, the rebase process will pause and give you a chance to alter the commit message",0
Any changes made by the commit are not affected,0
"editIf you choose to edit a commit, you'll be given the chance to amend the commit, meaning that you can add or change the commit entirely",0
You can also make more commits before you continue the rebase,0
"This allows you to split a large commit into smaller ones, or, remove erroneous changes made in a commit",0
squashThis command lets you combine two or more commits into a single commit,0
A commit is squashed into the commit above it,0
Git gives you the chance to write a new commit message describing both changes,0
"fixupThis is similar to squash, but the commit to be merged has its message discarded",0
"The commit is simply merged into the commit above it, and the earlier commit's message is used to describe both changes",0
execThis lets you run arbitrary shell commands against a commit,0
"An example of using git rebaseNo matter which command you use, Git will launch your default text editor and open a file that details the commits in the range you've chosen",0

"# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted",0
"#Breaking this information, from top to bottom, we see that:Seven commits are listed, which indicates that there were seven changes between our starting point and our current branch state",0
The commits you chose to rebase are sorted in the order of the oldest changes (at the top) to the newest changes (at the bottom),0
"Each line lists a command (by default, pick), the commit SHA, and the commit message",0

You can configure Git to handle line endings automatically so you can collaborate effectively with people who use different operating systems,0
Global settings for line endingsThe git config core,0
autocrlf command is used to change how Git handles line endings,0
It takes a single argument,0
"On macOS, you simply pass input to the configuration",0
For example:$ git config --global core,0
"autocrlf input# Configure Git to ensure line endings in files you checkout are correct for macOSOn Windows, you simply pass true to the configuration",0
For example:$ git config --global core,0
autocrlf true# Configure Git to ensure line endings in files you checkout are correct for Windows,0
"# For compatibility, line endings are converted to Unix style when you commit files",0
"On Linux, you simply pass input to the configuration",0
For example:$ git config --global core,0
"autocrlf input# Configure Git to ensure line endings in files you checkout are correct for LinuxPer-repository settingsOptionally, you can configure a",0
gitattributes file to manage how Git reads line endings in a specific repository,0
"When you commit this file to a repository, it overrides the core",0
autocrlf setting for all repository contributors,0
"This ensures consistent behavior for all users, regardless of their Git settings and environment",0
The,0
gitattributes file must be created in the root of the repository and committed like any other file,0
A,0
gitattributes file looks like a table with two columns:On the left is the file name for Git to match,0
On the right is the line ending configuration that Git should use for those files,0
ExampleHere's an example,0
gitattributes file,1
"You can use it as a template for your repositories:# Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core",0
autocrlf set,0
* text=auto# Explicitly declare text files you want to always be normalized and converted# to native line endings on checkout,0
*,1
c text*,0
h text# Declare files that will always have CRLF line endings on checkout,0
*,1
sln text eol=crlf# Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified,0
*,1
png binary*,0
jpg binaryYou'll notice that files are matched—*,0
"c, *",0
"sln, *",0
"png—, separated by a space, then given a setting—text, text eol=crlf, binary",0
We'll go over some possible settings below,0
text=auto Git will handle the files in whatever way it thinks is best,0
This is a good default option,0
text eol=crlf Git will always convert line endings to CRLF on checkout,0
"You should use this for files that must keep CRLF endings, even on OSX or Linux",0
text eol=lf Git will always convert line endings to LF on checkout,0
"You should use this for files that must keep LF endings, even on Windows",0
"binary Git will understand that the files specified are not text, and it should not try to change them",0
The binary setting is also an alias for -text -diff,0
Refreshing a repository after changing line endingsWhen you set the core,0
autocrlf option or commit a,0
"gitattributes file, you may find that Git reports changes to files that you have not modified",0
Git has changed line endings to match your new configuration,0
"To ensure that all the line endings in your repository match your new configuration, backup your files with Git, delete all files in your repository (except the",0
"git directory), then restore the files all at once",0
"Save your current files in Git, so that none of your work is lost",1

The GitHub Archive Program enables third-party partners to archive public repositories using the public API,0
These partners archive different types of data at varying frequencies and make the data available to the public,0
The GitHub Archive Program also protects the data on an ongoing basis by storing multiple copies across various data formats and locations,0
"For example, GitHub stores repositories in the Arctic Code Vault, a very-long-term archive intended to last at least 1,000 years",0
"For more information, see GitHub Archive Program",0
Responsible use of archives includes respecting users' privacy,0

"""Adding an open source license to increase archivabilityLibraries and researchers may require legal protections to create archives of publicly available content",0

"Forking a repository is similar to copying a repository, with two major differences:You can use a pull request to suggest changes from your user-owned fork to the original repository, also known as the upstream repository",0
You can bring changes from the upstream repository to your local fork by synchronizing your fork with the upstream repository,0
You can fork a repository to your user account or any organization where you have repository creation permissions,0
"For more information, see ""Permission levels for an organization",0
"""If you have access to a private repository and the owner permits forking, you can fork the repository to your user account or any organization on GitHub Team where you have repository creation permissions",0

"""Deleting a fork will not delete the original upstream repository",0
"You can make any changes you want to your fork—add collaborators, rename files, generate GitHub Pages—with no effect on the original",0
You cannot restore a deleted forked repository,0
"For more information, see ""Restoring a deleted repository",0
"""In open source projects, forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are offered back to the upstream repository",0
"When you make changes in your user-owned fork and open a pull request that compares your work to the upstream repository, you can give anyone with push access to the upstream repository permission to push changes to your pull request branch",0
This speeds up collaboration by allowing repository maintainers the ability to make commits or run tests locally to your pull request branch from a user-owned fork before merging,0
You cannot give push permissions to a fork owned by an organization,0
Private forks inherit the permissions structure of the upstream or parent repository,0
"For example, if the upstream repository is private and gives read/write access to a team, then the same team will have read/write access to any forks of the private upstream repository",0
This helps owners of private repositories maintain control over their code,0
"If you want to create a new repository from the contents of an existing repository but don't want to merge your changes upstream in the future, you can duplicate the repository or, if the repository is a template, use the repository as a template",0

You can install integrations in your personal account or organizations you own,0
You can also install GitHub Apps from a third-party in a specific repository where you have admin permissions or which is owned by your organization,0
"Differences between GitHub Apps and OAuth AppsIntegrations can be GitHub Apps, OAuth Apps, or anything that utilizes GitHub APIs or webhooks",0
GitHub Apps offer granular permissions and request access to only what the app needs,0
GitHub Apps also offer specific user-level permissions that each user must authorize individually when an app is installed or when the integrator changes the permissions requested by the app,0
"For more information, see:""Differences between GitHub Apps and OAuth Apps""""About apps""""User-level permissions""""Authorizing OAuth Apps""""Reviewing your authorized integrations""You can install a preconfigured GitHub App, if the integrators or app creators have created their app with the GitHub App manifest flow",0
"For information about how to  run your GitHub App with automated configuration, contact the integrator or app creator",0
You can create a GitHub App with simplified configuration if you build your app with Probot,0
"For more information, see the Probot docs site",0
Discovering integrations in GitHub MarketplaceYou can find an integration to install or publish your own integration in GitHub Marketplace,0
GitHub Marketplace contains GitHub Apps and OAuth Apps,0
"For more information on finding an integration or creating your own integration, see ""About GitHub Marketplace",0
"""Integrations purchased directly from integratorsYou can also purchase some integrations directly from integrators",0
"As an organization member, if you find a GitHub App that you'd like to use, you can request that an organization approve and install the app for the organization",0
"If you have admin permissions for all organization-owned repositories the app is installed on, you can install GitHub Apps with repository-level permissions without having to ask an organization owner to approve the app",0
"When an integrator changes an app's permissions, if the permissions are for a repository only, organization owners and people with admin permissions to a repository with that app installed can review and accept the new permissions",0
"To automate common tasks, back up your data, or create integrations that extend GitHub, you can use the GitHub API",0
"For more information about the API, see the GitHub REST API and GitHub GraphQL API",0
You can also stay current with API-related news by following the GitHub Developer blog,0

Forks are listed alphabetically by the username of the person who forked the repository,0
You can click on the username to be redirected to the user's GitHub profile page or click on the fork name to be redirected to the specific fork of the repository,0
"Accessing the Members graphOn GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository",0
"Under your repository name, click  Insights",1
"In the left sidebar, click Forks",1
"On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository",1
"To the right of the list of files, click Releases or Latest release",1
Find the release you want to link to and click the version number,1
"Alternatively, right click Latest Release and copy the URL to share it",1
The suffix of this URL is always /releases/latest,1
"To link directly to a download of your latest release asset, link to /owner/name/releases/latest/download/asset-name",0

Commits and pull requests that include prose documents have the ability to represent those documents with source and rendered views,0
"The source view shows the raw text that has been typed, while the renderedview shows how that text would look once it's rendered on GitHub",0
"For example,this might be the difference between showing **bold** in Markdown, and bold in the rendered view",0
Prose rendering is supported for rendered documents supported by github/markup:MarkdownAsciiDocTextileReStructuredTextRdocOrgCreoleMediaWikiPodYou can click  to see the changes made to the document as part of a commit,0
"Visualizing attribute changesWe provide a tooltipdescribing changes to attributes that, unlike words, would not otherwise be visible in the rendered document",0
"For example, if a link URL changes from one website toanother, we'd show a tooltip like this:Commenting on changesCommit comments can onlybe added to files within the source view, on a line-by-line basis",0
"Linking to headersAs with other rendered prose documents,hovering over a header in your document creates a link icon",0
You can link readersof your rendered prose diff to specific sections,0
"Viewing complex diffsSome pull requests involve a large number of changes with large, complex documents",0
"When the changes take too long to analyze, GitHub can't always produce a rendered view of the changes",0
"If this happens, you'll see an error message when you click the rendered button",0
You can still use the source view to analyze and comment on changes,0
Viewing HTML elementsWe don't directly support rendered views of commits to HTML documents,0
"Some formats, such as Markdown, let you embed arbitrary HTML in a document",0
"When these documents are shown on GitHub, some of that embedded HTML can be shown in a preview, while some (like an embedded YouTube video) cannot",0
"In general, rendered views of changes to a document containing embedded HTML will show changes to the elements that are supported in GitHub's view of the document",0
Changes to documents containing embedded HTML should always be reviewed in both the rendered and source views for completeness,0
GitHub supports rendering tabular data in the form of,0
csv (comma-separated) and,0
tsv (tab-separated) files,0
"When viewed, any",0
csv or,0
"tsv file committed to a GitHub repository automatically renders as an interactive table, complete with headers and row numbering",0
"By default, we'll always assume the first row is your header row",0
"You can link to a particular row by clicking the row number, or select multiple rows by holding down the shift key",0
Just copy the URL and send it to a friend,0
"Searching dataIf you want to find a certain value in your dataset, you can start typing in the search bar directly above the file",0
"The rows will filter automatically:Handling errorsOccasionally, you may discover that your CSV or TSV file isn't rendering",0
"In those instances, an error box appears at the bottom of your raw text, suggesting what the error may be",0
Common errors include:Mismatched column counts,0
"You must have the same number of separators in each row, even if the cell is blankExceeding the file size",0
Our rendering only works for files up to 512KB,0
Anything bigger than that slows down the browser,0

GitHub supports Subversion clients via the HTTPS protocol,0
We use a Subversion bridge to communicate svn commands to GitHub,0
Supported Subversion features on GitHubCheckoutThe first thing you'll want to do is a Subversion checkout,0
"Since Git clones keep the working directory (where you edit files) separate from the repository data, there is only one branch in the working directory at a time",0
"Subversion checkouts are different: they mix the repository data in the working directories, so there is a working directory for each branch and tag you've checked out",0
"For repositories with many branches and tags, checking out everything can be a bandwidth burden, so you should start with a partial checkout",0
"On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository",1
"Above the list of files, click  Code",1
"To clone the repository using HTTPS, under ""Clone with HTTPS"", click",1
"To clone the repository using an SSH key, including a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, click Use SSH, then click",1

Creating branchesYou can also create branches using the Subversion bridge to GitHub,0
"From your svn client, make sure the default branch is current by updating trunk:$ svn up trunk&gt; At revision 1",0
"Next, you can use svn copy to create a new branch:$ svn copy trunk branches/more_awesome&gt; A    branches/more_awesome$ svn commit -m 'Added more_awesome topic branch'&gt; Adding    branches/more_awesome&gt; Committed revision 2",0

Viewing imagesYou can directly browse and view images in your GitHub repository:SVGs don't currently support inline scripting or animation,0
"Viewing differencesYou can visually compare images in three different modes: 2-up, swipe, and onion skin",0
2-up2-up is the default mode; it gives you a quick glimpse of both images,0
"In addition, if the image has changed size between versions, the actual dimension change is displayed",0
"This should make it very apparent when things are resized, such as when assets are upgraded to higher resolutions",0
SwipeSwipe lets you view portions of your image side by side,0
Not sure if colors shifted between different versions? Drag the swipe slider over the area in question and compare the pixels for yourself,0

Did an icon shift two pixels to the left? Drag the opacity slider back a bit and notice if things move around,0

Including subprojectsA subproject is a project that's developed and managed somewhere outside of your main project,0
You typically import a subproject to add some functionality to your project without needing to maintain the code yourself,0
"Whenever the subproject is updated, you can synchronize it with your project to ensure that everything is up-to-date",0
"In SVN, a subproject is called an SVN external",0
"In Git, it's called a Git submodule",0
"Although conceptually similar, Git submodules are not kept up-to-date automatically; you must explicitly ask for a new version to be brought into your project",0
"For more information, see “Git Tools Submodules"" in the Git documentation",0
Preserving historySVN is configured to assume that the history of a project never changes,0
Git allows you to modify previous commits and changes using tools like git rebase,0
"GitHub supports Subversion clients, which may produce some unexpected results if you're using both Git and SVN on the same project",0
"If you've manipulated Git's commit history, those same commits will always remain within SVN's history",0
"If you accidentally committed some sensitive data, we have an article that will help you remove it from Git's history",0

"""File and repository size limitationsTo ensure performance and reliability for our users, we actively monitor signals of overall repository health",0
"Repository health is a function of various interacting factors, including size, commit frequency, contents, and structure",0
"We recommend repositories remain small, ideally less than 1 GB, and less than 5 GB is strongly recommended",0
Smaller repositories are faster to clone and easier to work with and maintain,0
Individual files in a repository are strictly limited to a 100 MB maximum size limit,0
"For more information, see ""Working with large files",0
"""If your repository excessively impacts our infrastructure, you might receive an email from GitHub Support asking you to take corrective action",0
"We try to be flexible, especially with large projects that have many collaborators, and will work with you to find a resolution whenever possible",0
You can prevent your repository from impacting our infrastructure by effectively managing your repository's size and overall health,0
You can find advice and a tool for repository analysis in the github/git-sizer repository,0
"Note: If you add a file to a repository via a browser, the file can be no larger than 25 MB",0
"For more information, see ""Adding a file to a repository",0
"""BackupsGit is not designed to serve as a backup tool",0
"However, there are many solutions specifically designed for performing backups, such as Arq, Carbonite, and CrashPlan",0
"Database dumpsVersion control systems, such as Git, are not designed to handle large SQL files",0
"To share large databases with other developers, we recommend using Dropbox",0
Git shouldn't be used to backup your production servers,0
"For more information, see ""Backups",0
"""External dependenciesExternal dependencies can cause Git repositories to become very large",0
"To avoid filling a repository with external dependencies, we recommend you use a package manager",0
"Popular package managers for common languages include Bundler, Node's Package Manager, and Maven",0
"These package managers support using Git repositories directly, so you don't need pre-packaged sources",0
Packaged release versionsWe don't recommend distributing compiled code and pre-packaged releases within your repository,0
"For more information, see ""Distributing large binaries",0
